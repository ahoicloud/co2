Average Carbon intensity Data
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The average carbon intensity data bundled in CO2.js is republished from Ember Climate, under the same CC-BY-SA licencing terms.

Please see the full licence at the link below for more along with any further disclaimers about liability for use. For convenience we republish the body of the disclaimer below, along with a link to full methodology information:

"The data used in this library is provided on an ‘as is’ basis. Data is assembled using the best available data at the time of publication.

Marginal Carbon intensity data
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The marginal carbon intensity data bundled in CO2.js is published by the Green Web Foundation under the same permissive CC-BY-SA license as the average carbon intensity data. This data is largely based on the operating marginal intensity data published by International Financial Institutions Technical Working group (the IFI TWG) project within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (the UNFCCC), to harmonize project-level greenhouse gas emissions accounting.

The data used in this report is provided on an ‘as is’ basis. Data is assembled using the best available data at the time of publication. Every effort has been made to ensure accuracy, and where possible we compare multiple sources to confirm their agreement. We take no responsibility for errors.
