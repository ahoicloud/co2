Every byte of data thatâ€™s uploaded or downloaded produces CO2. By being able to calculate these emissions, developers can enabled themself and their users to create more efficient, lower carbon decisions. Here are a few examples:
+ Create a carbon budget for your site
+ Inform the user when they uploading or downloading carbon intensive files


The package uses the yearly average grid intensity data from [Ember](https://ember-climate.org/data/data-explorer/), as well as marginal intensity data from the [UNFCCC](https://unfccc.int/) (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change).

The package is build for Laravel and heavy inspired by [thegreenwebfoundation/co2.js](https://github.com/thegreenwebfoundation/co2.js)



## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require ahoicloud/co2
```

You can publish the config file with:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="co2-config"
```

This is the contents of the published config file:

```php
return [

    'KWH_PER_GB' => 0.81,
    'END_USER_DEVICE_ENERGY' => 0.52,
    'NETWORK_ENERGY' => 0.14,
    'DATACENTER_ENERGY' => 0.15,
    'PRODUCTION_ENERGY' => 0.19,
    'GLOBAL_GRID_INTENSITY' => 442,
    'RENEWABLES_GRID_INTENSITY' => 50,
    'FIRST_TIME_VIEWING_PERCENTAGE' => 0.75,
    'RETURNING_VISITOR_PERCENTAGE' => 0.25,
    'PERCENTAGE_OF_DATA_LOADED_ON_SUBSEQUENT_LOAD' => 0.02,

];
```


## Usage

```php
$co2 = new Ahoicloud\Co2();
echo $co2->energyPerByteByComponent($byte);
```

## Testing
